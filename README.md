Future plans:
extending the project
you've done all the required steps, but if you'd like to make the game your own, here are some ideas:

- [ ] add a scoring system
- [ ] implement multiple lives and respawning
- [ ] add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- [ ] add acceleration to the player movement
- [ ] make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- [ ] add a background image
- [ ] create different weapon types
- [ ] make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- [ ] make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- [ ] add a shield power-up
- [ ] add a speed power-up
- [ ] add bombs that can be dropped
